DSI SVA Final Project

Project Title: 
Farming in the United States: Owning, Operating, and Profiting off Land

Desciption: 
I made this map to try and answer the question: if I wanted to start a farm where might I go to do that? 
Looking strictly at the financial profile of a farm, there are a few things I would want to take into consideration: 
+ Which state makes the most money? Consideration: Where is most of US grown food coming from? 
+ Which state has the most farms? Consideration: Market saturation and industrial infrastructure 
+ What's the average size of a farm in that state? Consideration: small vs. large farm community 
+ How much does an acre of land cost? Consideration: how much can I get for my money? 
+ How much value do my products have there? Consideration: Where will my returns be highest? 
+ How much does it cost to run a farm there? Consideration: land, expense, and profit balance 
+ How much does a farm net annually? Consideration: what will my ultimate return be?

Project Procedure:
I have an interest in the state of farming in the USA. I started with analyzing the imports and exports of our country to try and
create a narrative around how dependent we are on the rest of the word for our excessive consumer appetite. I was having trouble
piecing the data together so I turned to another thought I've had — personal preference aside, if I wanted to start a farm or
fund the start of one (i.e. I hire a farmer because that is not my skillset), what kind of financial details would I want to consider?
So I thought a real-estate like analysis, but with farming concerns — price of land, cost of expenses, agricultural product value — would 
be a unique question to try and get at. 

I sourced my data from the USDA Agricultural Census 2012. The next ones comes out at the end of the year I believe. After that I manually 
inputted the data for all 50 states across all 7 maps = 350 data points.

I realized my struggle was finding a way to compare a few of the data points at the same time — for example cost of acres with expenses
or expenses and net profit. To get at that a bit I created the regional comparison seen at the bottom. I would like to pair this with
a map of what is grown most in these regions as well as what percentage of the cash receipts are made on local distribution versus exports.
Given another data visualization I looked at I'd say the latter will not be the kindest of numbers — at least if youre interest is in
the agricultural self-sufficiency of our country and the strength of local food systems from region to region. 

All in all this was a lot of fun. I have a farmer friend who I think will enjoy seeing how other states fair in comparison to him. 
He's in Miami, Florida. I would like to update it come the release of the 2017 census report. It would be interested to see how things
have changed in just 5 years. There is a lot of talk regarding technology affecting agricutlrual yield (increasing) so I'd like to 
see how the states with the largest farms are affecting the cash receipts totals per state. Could be cool!
